###### I would like to visit The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art

>In early 2016, The Temptation of St. Anthony, a small panel long attributed to the workshop of Hieronymus Bosch, was credited to the painter himself after **forensic investigation** of its underpainting; it was added to the ranks of only 25 authenticated **Bosch** paintings in the world

1. From kansas City Airport the best way to travel is by bus.
2. Take Line 229 bus or line 47 bus.
